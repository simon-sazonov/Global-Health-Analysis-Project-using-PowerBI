# Global Health Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes global health trends using data from the World Bank and visualizes key insights through Power BI. By examining critical health indicators such as cancer mortality rates, maternal health expenditures, pollution impacts, and digital health adoption, this project provides data-driven insights into global health disparities, trends, and outcomes. The findings are designed to support stakeholders in making informed decisions that promote global health improvements.

This README details the project's structure, methodologies, and each visualized health topic. Each visualization offers a unique perspective on factors affecting health globally, from socio-economic influences to environmental impacts.

## Introduction

This project leverages Power BI to analyze a range of health indicators from the World Bank's Open Data platform. The analysis includes indicators such as cancer mortality, maternal health spending, pollution, and the impact of digital health solutions. This structured approach allows for a detailed exploration of global health disparities and informs recommendations for future public health policies.

## Methodology and Data Treatment

1. **Data Collection**: Health data was sourced from World Bank in Excel and CSV formats, covering various health metrics and socio-economic indicators.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
    - **Normalization**: Standardized country names and measurement units to ensure consistent analysis.
    - **Unpivoting and Date Formatting**: Converted year data into a date format to support time-series analysis.
    - **Handling Irregularities**: Addressed missing values, duplicates, and adjusted scales to enhance data integrity.
3. **Modeling and Visualization**:
    - **Dimensional Modeling**: Used a star schema to optimize performance, with dimensional tables (e.g., countries, years) linked to fact tables containing health metrics.
    - **Dynamic Reporting**: Established dynamic parameters for seamless updates as new data becomes available.
    - **Visual Accessibility**: Optimized visualizations for mobile access, ensuring they are actionable and easily interpretable.

This methodological framework enables robust, dynamic insights into global health trends while maintaining data integrity.
